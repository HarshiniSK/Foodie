<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
<p>When we started to discuss the
ideas for the project, We were
very concerned about two
constraints.
We need to prepare a feel-good
application and we need to
choose the main core commodity
of the app, in such a way that it is
very much relatable
to everyone's life and it must also
stimulate some good memories
that the
a client would enjoy the results.
Without a second thought the first
think that struck over my mind is
food.
So that's how it got matrially
developed
so we ended up finally with social
media for food and not anything
more than that. so anyone who
loves food will like our app .
